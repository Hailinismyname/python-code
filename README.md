# python-code
Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written. For a beginner of python and data analyst, I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient or simplify the code. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at 610422485@qq.com.

The scripts and comments in the scripts are written and viewed in Jupyter Notebook.
